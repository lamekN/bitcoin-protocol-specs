# Bitcoin Protocol Glossary

A collection of technical terms and concepts referenced throughout this research archive.

### 🛡️ Cryptographic Basics
* **Entropy:** The random 256-bit number that serves as the "seed" for all private keys.
* **secp256k1:** The specific Elliptic Curve used by Bitcoin to derive public keys from private keys.
* **Hashlock:** A restriction that prevents funds from being spent unless the spender reveals a "preimage" that hashes to a specific value.
* **Schnorr Signatures:** A more efficient and private signature scheme (introduced via Taproot) that allows for "signature aggregation."

### 🏗️ On-Chain Mechanics
* **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output):** The discrete units of bitcoin that exist on the ledger. You don't have a "balance"; you have a collection of UTXOs.
* **Change Address:** An address generated by a wallet to receive the "leftover" bitcoin from a transaction when the input is larger than the payment.
* **Merkle Root:** A single hash that represents a whole tree of data (like transactions in a block or scripts in a Taproot tree).
* **Bech32 (SegWit):** The address format (starting with `bc1`) that is more efficient and prevents human typing errors.

### 🕵️ Advanced Protocols (BIPs)
* **MAST (Merkle Alternative Script Trees):** A way to hide complex spending conditions in a Merkle tree, revealing only the one you actually use.
* **Key Tweaking:** Mathematically modifying a public key with extra data (like a Merkle Root) so that the new key is still valid but carries a hidden commitment.
* **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman):** The math that allows two people to create a shared secret using each other's public keys.

### ⚡ Layer 2 (Lightning)
* **HTLC (Hashed Time-Locked Contract):** The "engine" of Lightning. It ensures a payment either reaches the destination (Hashlock) or is returned to the sender (Timelock).
* **Funding Transaction:** The on-chain "anchor" that opens a Lightning channel.
* **Commitment Transaction:** An off-chain transaction that reflects the current balance of a Lightning channel.
* **Preimage:** The secret "key" that unlocks a Hashlock.
